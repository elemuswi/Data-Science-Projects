##Exercise 4.1
###Good Visualization
![Good Visualization](http://nordic.businessinsider.com/contentassets/e4fcb564fc6c49629ee858346ba4182a/5a318f7f4aa6b519158b4995.png?preset=article-image)

This is a good and clear visualization that conveys that the number of minority head coaches in the NFL is increasing. The visualization is free from any distraction, is well labeled and has a title. Overall it is easy to understand it.


###Bad Visualization

This is a bad visualization that tries to convey that the player decreased his knuckleball velocity from a previous year. The graph is misleading since the bin size makes it seem that his original velocity halfed, while the drop is not that signigicant. 


```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2)
data("hiphop_cand_lyrics")
```

##Exercise 4.2 

a) "A data frame with 377 rows representing hip-hop songs referencing POTUS candidates in 2016 and 8 variables."

Each case represent a hip-hop song that has a reference to POTUS candidates.

b) 
Summarize the number of cases in hiphop_cand_lyrics
```{r}
nrow(hiphop_cand_lyrics)
```
The number of cases is 377

Examine the first cases of hiphop_cand_lyrics
```{r}
head(hiphop_cand_lyrics)
```

```{r}
names(hiphop_cand_lyrics)
```

##Exercise 4.3

Use an RStudio function to determine the category labels used for the candidate variable.
```{r}
class(hiphop_cand_lyrics$candidate)
```

Construct a table of the number of cases that fall into each candidate category.
```{r}
tab<-table(hiphop_cand_lyrics$candidate)
tab
```
Construct a single plot that allows you to investigate the prevalence of each candidate in hip hop. Make the following modifications:
```{r}
ggplot(hiphop_cand_lyrics, aes(x=candidate))+geom_bar(fill="light blue")+labs(x="candidate name", y="number of songs")
```

Summarize your findings about the 2016 candidates in hip hop.
Donald Trump appeared the most times (268), followed by Hillary Clinton (92).

##Exercise 4.4

Construct a histogram of the release dates

```{r}
ggplot(hiphop_cand_lyrics, aes(x=album_release_date))+geom_histogram(binwidth =1, fill="light blue")
```

Construct a density plot of the release dates:
```{r}
ggplot(hiphop_cand_lyrics, aes(x=album_release_date))+geom_density(fill="grey")
```

Summarize your findings about release date:
Between 2012 and 2017 the number of hip hop songs released that refer to presidential candidates increased substantially.

##Exercise 4.5


```{r}
mean(hiphop_cand_lyrics$album_release_date)
median(hiphop_cand_lyrics$album_release_date)
```

```{r}
ggplot(hiphop_cand_lyrics, aes(x=album_release_date,))+geom_density(fill="blue", alpha=0.5)+ggtitle("Album Release Dates")+geom_vline(xintercept =2011, color="blue")+geom_vline(xintercept = 2008.459, color="red")+xlim(1980,2020)
```
